# SEC-15 — Credential encryption

**Priority** P1 (provisional) · **Score** 25% as of 2026-11-06 · **Prior ledger state** PARTIAL · **Source reviewed** `56ea5a18fbd215ad1085a1bb1c753bbdd5688fa1`

## Planned user outcome

Credential encryption. Canonical scope and original acceptance notes: [capability ledger](../CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md). The prior record says: Qualify the merged behavior for this exact capability, complete its supported modes and authenticated product composition. Original acceptance checklist (new source alone does not satisfy it): Qualify authorization, authenticated metadata, interrupted rotation/recovery, restricted permissions and actual service injection; integrate API/UI and closure.

## Code implementation

| Question | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Feature-specific code credited? | Component gate credited | Merged PR #102; modules/secrets: AEAD, scoped file storage and rotation; tracker reports nine tests. Service injection E2E remains BLOCKED; full rotation failure qualification remains required. 3 November source review: #218: Versioned encrypted secrets, authenticated scope metadata and interrupted rotation recovery. |
| Entire feature connected to product? | **Not established** | Qualify the merged behavior for this exact capability, complete its supported modes and authenticated product composition. Original acceptance checklist (new source alone does not satisfy it): Qualify authorization, authenticated metadata, interrupted rotation/recovery, restricted permissions and actual service injection; integrate API/UI and closure. |

## Tests, separate from implementation

| Test type | Existing or historical test evidence | Result for source `56ea5a18fbd215ad1085a1bb1c753bbdd5688fa1` |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Component-owner test source found: No test file located under the component-owner paths.. Historical ledger statement: tracker reports nine tests. Service injection E2E remains BLOCKED; | **Not individually rerun or mapped to this feature in this review.** |
| Integration | Integration-owner test source found: `integration/security/tests/security_tests.rs`, `modules/security/tests/integration_stubs.rs`. File presence does not prove this feature is covered or that it passed. | **No feature-specific current run recorded.** |
| N2N / full end-to-end | E2E-owner test source found: No test file located under the E2E-owner paths.. Source is not a passing product journey. | **No feature-specific current run recorded.** |
| Manual | No manual result cited in the feature ledger. | **No manual run recorded.** |
